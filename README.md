# 📝 PandaDoc Document Editor Demo

This project is a **demo document editor inspired by PandaDoc’s platform**, built to showcase modern front-end architecture, drag-and-drop interactions, and real-time editing patterns. It is not an official PandaDoc product, but a **personal project for learning and portfolio purposes**.

This project was created as part of my preparation for **system design and front-end interviews at PandaDoc**.
