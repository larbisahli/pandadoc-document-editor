# PandaDoc Document Editor (Demo)

This project is a **demo document editor inspired by PandaDocâ€™s platform**, built to showcase modern front-end architecture, drag-and-drop interactions, and real-time editing patterns. It is not an official PandaDoc product, but a **personal project for learning and portfolio purposes**.

The editor demonstrates:

- **Flexible document schema** with nested blocks, rows, and fields
- **Drag-and-drop system** (custom hook + draggable wrapper) for adding and rearranging blocks
- **Edge-based hover detection** with visual highlights for precise placement
- **Undo/redo history** and normalized app state for predictable updates

This project was created as part of my preparation for **system design and front-end interviews at PandaDoc**.

<!-- TODO -->

- Block hover drop lines get close to edge problem

- add filed by click (middle)
- move thunk and action types
- useClickOutside in all blocks and fields
- editor slice more types
- fix root container not found (adding to blank page)
- clean up junk code from editor
